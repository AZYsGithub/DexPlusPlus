# Dex++
![PreviewImage](/preview.png)
Dex++ is a revival of Moon's Dex, made to fulfill some Moon's Dex prophecy.

## Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/refs/heads/master/out.lua"))()
```

## What's the difference between Dex and Dex++?
Since the original Dex is the last release and Moon have discontinued it, it still has some missing features such as "Click part to select".
Dex++ is a fork of Moon's Dex and still be maintained actively.
Here are the features that were added/fixed in Dex++
- Uses Konstant as fallback decompiler
- Uses [USSI](https://github.com/luau/UniversalSynSaveInstance/tree/main) as fallback saveinstance
- Mobile Input Support
- Console Output
- Model Viewer
- Revived Save Instance
- Click part to select (thx Toon :3)
- CodeFrame cursor offset (where cursor on textbox were not aligned properly)

## To Build
1. Download this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3 (I use 3.9.0)
3. Run build.py
4. The executable script will be created as out.lua
